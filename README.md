5.2 Frontend Setup
The frontend files (HTML, CSS, JS) are located in the frontend/static and frontend/templates directories. These will be rendered by Django templates.

Base Template: frontend/templates/base.html
CSS: Styling is located in frontend/static/css/styles.css
JS: Add interactivity in frontend/static/js/ if needed.
6. Usage
Access the Platform: After running the development server, visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to access the Transparify platform.

Admin Dashboard: Access the admin interface at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ to view submitted feedback and manage users.

Submit Feedback: Users can fill out a form to submit their feedback. The feedback will be saved in the database.

7. Adding New Features
Authentication: Implement Django's authentication system to allow users to create accounts and login.
Admin Panel: Customize the Django admin panel to allow for moderation of feedback.
Real-Time Notifications: Add notifications or email functionality to alert administrators when new feedback is submitted.
8. Future Work
Data Visualization: Display feedback data using charts or graphs.
Localization: Add multi-language support to make the platform accessible to more users.
Mobile App: Develop a mobile version using Django REST API and React Native or Flutter.
9. Troubleshooting
MySQL Connection Issues: Ensure MySQL is running and credentials in settings.py are correct.
Static Files Not Loading: Ensure STATIC_URL and STATICFILES_DIRS are correctly configured in settings.py.
10. Conclusion
Transparify is a platform for citizen engagement aimed at fostering transparency in government processes. With its robust backend and simple, responsive frontend, it serves as a bridge between citizens and decision-makers.
